Design:
1. The server will listen to multiple client on a 54321 port number.
2. For current design, the server will accept 100 client connection.
3. The server will listen commands from multiple client.
4. The server will reply to respective client by sending result of command which will be executed on shell.
3. The Software will be written in C language.
4. Linux GCC will be used to complie the software.

Solution:
1. Threads will be used for multiple client connection.
2. Current solution will be tested using looped back ipv4 127.0.0.1

Instruction to build and run output as follows:
1. Create Server directory
2. Copy and paste server source file and makefile into it.
3. Present directory should be Server directory.
4. Run make command
5. If no errors, then proceed with following command
	./execname PORT
	where PORT is Port number passed as command line argument
6. Follow above 1 to 5 steps for client.


Known Limitations:
1. 2Kbytes static memory allocated for read and write buffer.
2. cd command is not working as per expections.

GCC version is 9.3.0
Linux osboxes 5.4.0 Ubuntu

Testing Result:
1. Run server as process in shell.
2. Created 4 instances of client in different shell as separate processes.
3. Server-Client communication is tested by connecting 4 clients simaltanously to server.
4. User entered commands on a one of connected client and it reached to server then server replied the result of command successfully.
